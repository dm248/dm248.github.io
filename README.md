# Some thoughts on b01lers CTF 2021

##### Apr 14, 2021

[b01lers CTF 2021](https://ctftime.org/event/1259)
happened about 10 days ago. I hope that each participant 
had a good time :) With the experience from last year, it went [pretty much 
flawlessly IMO...](/posts/20210414_bctf2021.md)


# Curious case of (13,4,1) shellsort

##### Oct 15, 2020

I tend to think back fondly to the good old times when I was a student but I must have had it easy. 
Here is an assignment someone else got recently: *Find the worst-case input for (13,4,1) shellsort
on 25 elements*. The official solver offered was simple, just shy of 1 billion core years to
run - trying all 25! permutations. So that got me curious, is the problem doable?
Well, it turns out that it is,
[just not quite that way...](/posts/20201015_shellsort.md)


# b01lers bootcamp CTF

##### Oct 8, 2020

We hosted [bootcamp CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1089) last weekend, 
This time I went for easy difficulty
and made a whole bunch of minichallenges (aka Crypto World). Things ran very smoothly, only a few
minor lessons to [learn from...](/posts/20201008_bootcampCTF.md)


# UIUCTF

##### Jul 26, 2020

I tried a couple problems at [UIUCTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1075) last weekend, crypto and pwn
mostly. It had an interesting mixture of simple and hard problems with not much in between. Overall,
it was fun and [educational...](/posts/20200726_UIUCTF.md)


# NahamCon 

##### Jun 15, 2020

[NahamCon CTF](https://ctftime.org/event/1067) was a fun event last weekend.
I only had about 10 hours for it, so I did what tends to suit me best: crypto plus some misc challenges.
Overall I scored close to 1500, which is OK but there is always room to do more.
Here are some of my thoughts about the [problems..](/posts/20200615_NahamCon.md)

# Where's the Sat @ Hack-A-Sat

##### Jun 7, 2020

Two weeks ago, the USAF and DDS put up a [Hack-A-Sat](https://www.hackasat.com/) space hacking challenge.
I only had time to check out a handful of the problems, one of which was Where's the Sat that asked people
to identify a satellite by location and time and then predict where it would be at another time. It turns out
that with the
right tools, such as [Skyfield](https://rhodesmill.org/skyfield/), the problem is straightforward 
(check, e.g., [here](https://medium.com/@pdelteil/wheres-the-sat-hack-a-sat-writeup-9a523634963b)). 
But the solution is not very satisfying unless one understands what goes on inside the black box... 
so if you are curious, [read on](/posts/20200607_Wheres_the_Sat.md)...

# GitHub Pages

##### Jun 6, 2020

I decided to give [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
a try so that I do not have to bother with hosting these posts elsewhere.
Take-off was quite smooth but not without a few [hiccups...](posts/20200606_GitHub_Pages.md)
